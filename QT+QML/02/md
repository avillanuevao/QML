This is a foundational example illustrating the integration of QML (Qt Meta-Object Language) and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The key aspect highlighted here is the usage of connect, which facilitates seamless communication between QML, responsible for the user interface, and C++, responsible for the underlying application logic and data management.

In this example, the QML scene is created dynamically, allowing for the flexible construction of the user interface based on the Model's data. This dynamic creation of the QML scene aligns with the core principles of the MVC pattern, where the Model holds the application's data, the View presents this data to the user, and the Controller manages the interaction between the Model and the View.

By dynamically creating the QML scene, the example showcases the adaptability of the MVC pattern to accommodate changes in the data and user interface requirements. This flexibility enhances maintainability and scalability, making it easier to evolve the application as it grows in complexity.
