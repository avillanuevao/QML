This is a foundational example illustrating the integration of QML (Qt Meta-Object Language) and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, focusing on the dynamic creation of a calculator with enhanced functionality. The key highlight here is the utilization of `connect`, which seamlessly facilitates communication between QML, responsible for the user interface, and C++, responsible for the underlying application logic and data management.

In this example, the QML scene is dynamically constructed, allowing for the flexible development of the calculator's user interface based on the Model's data. This dynamic creation adheres to the core principles of the MVC pattern, where the Model contains the application's data, the View presents this data to the user, and the Controller manages the interaction between the Model and the View.

By dynamically generating the QML scene, the example demonstrates the adaptability of the MVC pattern to accommodate changes in data and user interface requirements, specifically tailored for a calculator. This flexibility enhances maintainability and scalability, simplifying the evolution of the calculator application as it gains additional features and complexity.
